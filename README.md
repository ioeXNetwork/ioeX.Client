# ioeX.Client

## Summary

ioeX leveraged Elastos functions to create its owned features and also business cases.

This is the client program of the IOEX node, which is a command line tool to control node and see node info etc.
Also, this project including a light implementation of IOEX wallet, which can create your IOEX account, do receive, create, sign or send transactions.
You can run a node locally and set the miner address to your wallet account, then run the node to get your own IOEXs and do whatever you like.

## Build on Mac

### Check OS version

Make sure the OSX version is 16.7+

```shell
$ uname -srm
Darwin 16.7.0 x86_64
```

### Install Go distribution 1.9

Use Homebrew to install Golang 1.9.
```shell
$ brew install go@1.9
```
> If you install older version, such as v1.8, you may get missing math/bits package error when build.

### Setup basic workspace
In this instruction we use ~/dev/src as our working directory. If you clone the source code to a different directory, please make sure you change other environment variables accordingly (not recommended).

```shell
$ mkdir ~/dev/bin
$ mkdir ~/dev/src
```

### Set correct environment variables.

```shell
export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go@1.9/libexec
export GOPATH=$HOME/dev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
```

### Install Glide

Glide is a package manager for Golang. We use Glide to install dependent packages.

```shell
$ brew install --ignore-dependencies glide
```

### Check Go version and glide version
Check the golang and glider version. Make sure they are the following version number or above.
```shell
$ go version
go version go1.9.2 darwin/amd64

$ glide --version
glide version 0.13.1
```
If you cannot see the version number, there must be something wrong when install.

### Clone source code to $GOPATH/src/github.com/ioeXNetwork/ folder
Make sure you are in the folder of `$GOPATH/src/github.com/ioeXNetwork/`
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ioeXNetwork/ioeX.Client.git
```

If clone works successfully, you should see folder structure like $GOPATH/src/github.com/ioeXNetwork/ioeX.Client/Makefile

### Glide install

Run `glide update && glide install` to download project dependencies.

### Install sqlite database
This will make the `make` progress far more faster.
```shell
go install github.com/ioeXNetwork/ioeX.Client/vendor/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

### Make

Run `make` to build the executable files `ioex-cli`

$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:gophers/archive
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get install -y golang-1.9-go
```
> If you install older version, such as v1.8, you may get missing math/bits package error when build.

```

### Check Go version and glide version
Check the golang and glider version. Make sure they are the following version number or above.
```shell
$ go version
go version go1.9.2 linux/amd64

$ glide --version
glide version v0.13.1
```
If you cannot see the version number, there must be something wrong when install.

### Glide install

Run `glide update && glide install` to install depandencies.

### Install sqlite database
This will make the `make` progress far more fester.
```shell
go install github.com/ioeXNetwork/ioeX.Client/vendor/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

### Make

Run `make` to build the executable files `ioex-cli`


## Run on Mac/Ubuntu

### Set up configuration file
A file named `cli-config.json` should be placed in the same folder with `ioex-cli` with the parameters as below.
```
{
    "Host": "127.0.0.1:20336"
}
```
> `Host` is the IP and Port witch this client is communicate with. Usually `ioex-cli` is working with `node` together on the same machineï¼Œ
so mostly IP is set to `localhost` and `Port` value is according to the `HttpJsonPort` value set in the node `config.json` file.

### See node info
As the node is running, you can ge information from it by using `info` commands.
```shell
$ ./ioex-cli info
NAME:
   ioex-cli info - show node information

USAGE:
   ioex-cli info [command options] [args]

DESCRIPTION:
   With ioex-cli info, you could look up node status, query blocks, transactions, etc.

OPTIONS:
   --connections                         see how many peers are connected with current node
   --neighbor, --nbr                     show neighbor nodes information
   --state                               show current node status
   --currentheight, --height             show blockchain height on current not
   --getblockhash value, --blockh value  query a block's hash with it's height (default: -1)
   --getblock value, --block value       query a block with height or it's hash
   --gettransaction value, --tx value    query a transaction with it's hash
   --showtxpool, --txpool                show the transactions in node's transaction pool
```

### Mine
With `mine` command, you can toggle the node CPU mining, and when testing or try something else, waiting for the CPU mining is a waste of time, manual mine command can solve this problem.
To use manual mine, `ActiveNet` parameter in node config file should be set to `RegNet` and `AutoMining` must be set to `false`.
```shell
$ ./ioex-cli mine
NAME:
   ioex-cli mine - toggle cpu mining or manual mine

USAGE:
   ioex-cli mine [command options] [args]

DESCRIPTION:
   With ioex-cli mine, you can toggle cpu mining, or manual mine blocks.

OPTIONS:
   --toggle value, -t value  use --toggle [start, stop] to toggle cpu mining
   --number value, -n value  user --number [number] to mine the given number of blocks
```

### Log
This is the command to control node log print level, levels are from 0~6, the lower level the more logs will be print out, 0 means print out everything.
```shell
$ ./ioex-cli log
NAME:
   ioex-cli log - set node log output level

USAGE:
   ioex-cli log [command options] [args]

DESCRIPTION:
   With ioex-cli log, you could change node log output level.
   levels are 0~6, the lower level the more logs will be print out, 0 means print out everything

OPTIONS:
   --level value, -l value  --log level (default: -1)
```

### Wallet
For test purpose, this command line client implemented a simplified wallet program. You can use it to create your IOEX account, check account balance and build, sign or send transactions.
#### Tips
> for some reason, when using multiple command options, the option with no arguments must be put at the last, for example
`$ ./ioex-cli wallet --name my_wallet.dat --password ioeXNetwork --create`, in this case, `--create` must be put at the last, or the command will no work correctly.
```shell
$ ./ioex-cli wallet
NAME:
   ioex-cli wallet - wallet operations

USAGE:
   ioex-cli wallet [command options] [args]

DESCRIPTION:
   With ioex-cli wallet, you can create an account, check account balance or build, sign and send transactions.

OPTIONS:
   --password value, -p value     arguments to pass the password value
   --name value, -n value         to specify the created keystore file name or the keystore file path to open (default: "keystore.dat")

   --addaccount value             add a standard account with a public key, or add a multi-sign account with multiple public keys
                                  use -m to specify how many signatures are needed to create a valid transaction
                                  by default M is public keys / 2 + 1, witch means greater than half
   -m value                       the M value to specify how many signatures are needed to create a valid transaction (default: 0)
